# Sequence Containers
Sequence containers store the data in the linear manner. They are also used to implement container adaptors.
There are 5 sequence containers in C++ STL:

Arrays: The STL array is an implementation of a compile time non-resizable array. It contains various method for common array operations.
Vector: An STL vector can be defined as the dynamic sized array which can be resized automatically when new elements are added or removed.
Deque: Deque or Double-Ended Queue is sequence containers with the feature of expansion and contraction on both ends. It means we can add and remove the data to and from both ends.
Lists: List container stores data in non-contiguous memory unlike vectors and only provide sequential access to the stored data. It basically implements the doubly linked list.
Forward Lists: Forward lists also store the data in a sequential manner like lists, but with the difference that forward list stores the location of only the next elements in the sequence. It implements the singly linked list.
